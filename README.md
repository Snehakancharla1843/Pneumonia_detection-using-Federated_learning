Project Name: Pneumonia Detection using Federated Learning
Description
This project implements a pneumonia detection system using federated learning. It uses the Flower framework to perform federated learning on medical images, aiming to provide a decentralized and privacy-preserving solution for pneumonia detection.

Features
Federated Learning: Uses Flower framework for federated learning to train models across multiple clients without sharing data.
EfficientNet: Utilizes the EfficientNet architecture for accurate and efficient image classification.
Web Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface built with Flask for uploading and predicting pneumonia cases.
Custom Strategy: Implements a custom federated learning strategy with FedProx integration and attention mechanism.
